## Declaring variables

Declare a variable with the equals symbol `=`.

```
discount = 10%                         | 10%
cost =  200€                           | €200
cost - discount                        | €180
```

A variable can be a single word or an entire phrase (i.e. `red apples = 10`).

## Redefining variables

A variable can be redefined by giving it a new value.

The most recently defined value will be used on subsequent lines.

```
amount = 50€                           | €50
amount x 2                             | €100
amount = 20€                           | €20         
amount x 2                             | €40 
```
