## Headings

Use the `#` character to indicate a heading line. Heading lines are emboldened and do not display an answer (even if there are numbers in the heading).

```
# Heading 1                          |
## Heading 2                         |
### Heading 3                        |
#### Heading 4                       |
##### Heading 5                      |
###### Heading 6                     | 
```

## Comments

If you want to add a comment to your notes, use the `//` characters. Comments are not evaluated and do not display an answer.

```
// This is a comment                           |
// Comments can also start after an expression |
2 // the number of apples                      | 2
```
