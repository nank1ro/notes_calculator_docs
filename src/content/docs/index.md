"Notes calculator" is a notepad for working through problems that involve calculations. 
Type a calculation in the input field (left side), and the result will be displayed on the right side.
```

100 + 50%                            | 150
20% of 40                            | 8

100 dollars in euro                  | €85.39
60 degree in radians                 | 1,05 rad
1 kg in g                            | 1.000 g
1 day in seconds                     | 86.400 seconds

// You can also use variables: <-- this is a comment, which is ignored
discount = 10%                       | 10% 
cost = 550€                          | €550
cost - discount                      | €495
